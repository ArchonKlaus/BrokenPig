# BrokenPig [BETA]
A Network-System plugin based on PMMP for GoldenEye AntiCheat

Needs GoldenEye Anticheat and PocketCoord to work.

## What is BrokenPig

BrokenPig is a fast packet transfer used for running GoldenEye anticheat, for a better performance.
Also needs PocketCoord (GeneralMC Private port of BungeeCoord) for working.

## Why is this useful for GoldenEye?

Because without this plugin, GoldenEye will detect false hacking from players, and non-hackers will get kicked and banned.

## Is BrokenPig available to all servers?

No. BrokenPig is only a plugin that depends only on GoldenEye, so, if you not have that plugin, you will not able to use this.
